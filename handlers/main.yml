      A reboot is needed to complete the network configuration changes.
      Please reboot the system manually after the playbook completes.

      This is required because systemd-networkd was stopped and networking
      service changes require a full system reboot to take effect properly.

      Interfaces post-update:
      {{ grep_interfaces_post.stdout_lines | default('No output available') }}

      Please manually compare the network interfaces shown above with the
      expected configuration. If the interfaces don't match the expected
      output, contact the team and DO NOT REBOOT the system or you may lose network access.
